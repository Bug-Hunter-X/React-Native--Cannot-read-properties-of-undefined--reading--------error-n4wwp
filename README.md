# React Native: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native where attempting to access a state variable before it's initialized results in a `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '...')` error. The example shows how asynchronous operations within component lifecycle methods can cause this problem and provides a solution using optional chaining and the nullish coalescing operator.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the `bug.js` file. Observe the use of `stateVariable` before it has had time to initialize. 
3. Run the application to reproduce the error.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` uses optional chaining (`?.`) and the nullish coalescing operator (`??`) to gracefully handle the case where `stateVariable` is still undefined.
