In the provided `bug.js` example, the problem is that `stateVariable` is accessed within `useEffect` before the asynchronous operation to set its value has completed. The solution in `bugSolution.js` uses optional chaining (`?.`) to safely access `stateVariable`.  If `stateVariable` is undefined, the expression short-circuits, preventing the error. The nullish coalescing operator (`??`) provides a fallback value if `stateVariable` is null or undefined.
